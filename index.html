 <h2>Why Web Develpment</h2>
 <p class="special">Web development provides a generally universal solution to address this through the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

 <div>Websites can target the biggest and broadest audience, unlike the restrictions to a platform that constrain native applications. Your clients and customers can use the ease of any device, from a computer to mobile phone, as they have the capability to display your content through the web browser.</div>
